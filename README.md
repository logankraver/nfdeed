# NFDeeds

This project was developed for the Fintech at Cornell and Ava Labs Hackathon 

## Inspiration
We started with the idea to look to real-world tangible non-fungible assets and thinking of means to turn them into NFTs. We first began thinking of developing NFTs for trading cards, but after realizing that most major sports leagues already have their own NFT collections, we looked elsewhere. We finally determined that we should look to implement NFTs for property ownership due to its immense potential.

## What it does
Our project functions to develop simple NFTs that stores all relevant information for deeds e.g. location, shares, amount of ownership.

## How we built it
We built it primarily in solidity, utilizing bits of openzepellin's NFT wizard and IPFS to store the NFT metdata JSON.

## Challenges we ran into
We faced many barriers, when looking to implement our smart contracts due to our simple lack of experience and issues running into old documentation.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of our final result, leading to a simple, yet working smart contract that has easy ability to be scaled up.

## What we learned
We learned quite a bit about developing in Solidity and blockchain applications and also the process of developing a pitch.

## What's next for NFDeeds
We believe that the next steps for NFDeeds is the implementation of a support ERC-20 token along with a DAO to allow for possibility of voting utilizing one's ownership.
